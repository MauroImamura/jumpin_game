## Description

Browser game in side-scroller style for jumping obstacles and scoring on each right movement.

The player clicks to make the block jump over the obstacles that come in its direction.

Each obstacle avoided increases the score. Along the game, some bonus itens appear in the top portion of the screen that give extra points or extra shield charges.

At the beggining of the game, the player has three shield charges that are consumed when the block hits an obstacle. After losing all the charges, the following colision will result in the end of the game.

At this moment, the player will see the final screen that shows the current record. If the player scored over this record, the game will display a congratulations message.

## Commmands

Click to jump (up to three times in a row).
